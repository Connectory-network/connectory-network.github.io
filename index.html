      <p style="margin-top:-10px; color:grey">i really need to find a better rich text method</p>
      <p style="margin-top:-10px;">over the past few months ive been busy with doing education and stuff, as well as getting back into more creative things like animation and game development, holy moly I didn't realize how horrible the software experience for their software is. Randomly lines would disappear across the whole thing and I would have to redo every single stroke on that frame. It was really frustrating trying to rotoscope something on animate. Soooo I moved to illustrator thinking that the canvas movement and brush stroke system would be the same, its fundamentally different. Don't get me wrong it's really powerful software, but theres so many inconsistencies and little things here and there that add up to a horrible experience. When it works it's great but what disgusts me is how as large as a corperation like adobe can ruin a software like this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Flash">(macromedia flash 8 my beloved)</a>. But anyways finals are coming up and afterwards I'll try updating this more often. Hopefully I can actually get to a point where i can release the original purpose of this site (which was supposed to be a social media network similar to facebook from 2010 but I'm going a different route now after looking at some other designs (for some reason the ups 2005 site speaks to me lol). will make comments for these posts someday and will be post updates after finals. </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:-13px;">Welcome!</h2>
      <p style="margin-top:-10px;">Im using this site as a placeholder until I get everything in place for a project I've been working on, connectory. Currently I still have to finish the Projects page as well as getting DNS and everything setup, so far the site looks pretty good.</p>
